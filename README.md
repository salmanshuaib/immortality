# immortality
Pseudocode for a jab that achieves equilibrium between cancer and senescence via ensuring the optimum 9000 occurrences of TTAGGG (Telomere): 

```python
DO {
# In case cell is cancerous
IF occurrences of “TTAGGG” in Cell Chromosomal DNA > 15000
Call SenescenceFunction()
# Reset in case cell is dying
ELSEIF occurrences of “TTAGGG” in Cell Chromosomal DNA < 3000
Call ActivateTelomerase()
}
# infinity loop
WHILE count(TTAGGG) in Cell Chromosomal DNA > Zero

SenescenceFunction() {
# Initialize aging process
Delete 6000x “TTAGGG” from Cell Chromosomal DNA
Where preceding GENETIC CODE is “TTAGGG”
And succeeding GENETIC CODE is “TTAGGG”
}
ActivateTelomerase() {
#Effect Telomerase repairs of DNA
Append 6000x “TTAGGG” in Cell Chromosomal DNA
Where preceding GENETIC CODE is “TTAGGG”
And succeeding GENETIC CODE is “TTAGGG”.
}
